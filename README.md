## About the Project
This project is a **Data Processing System** designed to simulate multiple worker threads processing data in parallel. The system consists of:
- **Worker Threads**: Retrieve data from a shared queue, process it, and save the results to a shared resource.
- **Concurrency Models**: Implemented in both **Java** and **Go**, leveraging their respective concurrency mechanisms.
- **Key Features**:
  - Efficient management of shared resources.
  - Mechanisms to avoid deadlocks.
  - Robust error handling for concurrent operations.

This project is implemented in **two programming languages**:
1. **Java**
2. **Go**

The goal of this project is to showcase how concurrency and parallel processing can be implemented in two different programming languages, leveraging their unique features.

### **Explanation**
1. **`go/` Directory**
   - Contains Go code for the project.
   - **`main.go`**: The main entry point for the Go application. It initializes the task queue, starts worker goroutines, and processes tasks.
   - **`src/dataprocessor/`**: A subdirectory for modular Go components.
     - **`task.go`**: Defines the `Task` struct and its `Process` method for task-specific processing logic.
     - **`worker.go`**: Implements the worker function to process tasks using the shared queue and result saver.
     - **`sharedqueue.go`**: Manages a thread-safe task queue for communication between worker threads.
     - **`resultsaver.go`**: Handles saving the processed task results to a file.
     - **`go.mod`**: Go module configuration file defining the project dependencies and module path.

2. **`java/` Directory**
   - Contains Java code for the project.
   - **`src/main/java/com/example/`**: A package directory for Java components.
     - **`DataProcessorJava.java`**: The main entry point for the Java application. It initializes the task queue, assigns tasks to workers, and manages their lifecycle.
     - **`SharedQueue.java`**: Implements a thread-safe queue for managing tasks using `lock` and `wait/notify` mechanisms.
     - **`Worker.java`**: Defines the worker logic for processing tasks concurrently.
   - **`results_java.txt`**: A file containing the processed task results.

---

This repository appears to focus on parallel task processing using both **Go** and **Java**, with similar implementations in each language. Both implementations use shared queues and workers to process tasks concurrently, saving results to respective output files.

## How to Run

### Running Java Files
1. Navigate to the Java source directory:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/java
   ```
2. Compile using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn compile
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.MainClass"
   ```
   Replace `com.example.MainClass` with your main class name.

### Running Go Files
1. Navigate to the Go source directory:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/go
   ```
2. Run the Go program:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
   Replace `main.go` with the entry point file of your Go application if named differently.

## Notes
- Update the `path/to/java` and `path/to/go` with the respective paths to your Java and Go source directories within the repository.
- Make sure all dependencies are resolved before running the programs.
