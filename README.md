## About the Project
This project is a **Data Processing System** designed to simulate multiple worker threads processing data in parallel. The system consists of:
- **Worker Threads**: Retrieve data from a shared queue, process it, and save the results to a shared resource.
- **Concurrency Models**: Implemented in both **Java** and **Go**, leveraging their respective concurrency mechanisms.
- **Key Features**:
  - Efficient management of shared resources.
  - Mechanisms to avoid deadlocks.
  - Robust error handling for concurrent operations.

This project is implemented in **two programming languages**:
1. **Java**
2. **Go**

The goal of this project is to showcase how concurrency and parallel processing can be implemented in two different programming languages, leveraging their unique features.

### **Explanation**
1. **`go/` Directory**
   - Contains Go code for the project.
   - **`main.go`**: The main entry point for the Go application. It initializes the task queue, starts worker goroutines, and processes tasks.

2. **`java/` Directory**
   - Contains Java code for the project.
   - **`src/main/java/com/example/`**: A package directory for Java components.
     - **`DataProcessorJava.java`**: The main entry point for the Java application. It initializes the task queue, assigns tasks to workers, and manages their lifecycle.
     - **`SharedQueue.java`**: Implements a thread-safe queue for managing tasks using `lock` and `wait/notify` mechanisms.
     - **`Worker.java`**: Defines the worker logic for processing tasks concurrently.
   - **`results_java.txt`**: A file containing the processed task results.

---

This repository appears to focus on parallel task processing using both **Go** and **Java**, with similar implementations in each language. Both implementations use shared queues and workers to process tasks concurrently, saving results to respective output files.

## How to Run

### Running Java Files
1. Navigate to the Java source directory:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/java
   ```
2. Compile using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn compile
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.MainClass"
   ```
   Replace `com.example.MainClass` with your main class name.

### Running Go Files
1. Navigate to the Go source directory:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/go
   ```
2. Run the Go program:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
   Replace `main.go` with the entry point file of your Go application if named differently.

---

## Notes
- Update the `path/to/java` and `path/to/go` with the respective paths to your Java and Go source directories within the repository.
- Make sure all dependencies are resolved before running the programs.

- Based on the repository and the updated structure, here is an overview of the **uses of the application** and **how the code is implemented**:

---

### **Uses of the Application**
1. **Data Processing**:
   - This application is designed as a data processing system to handle tasks concurrently using worker threads or goroutines. 
   - It efficiently manages a queue of tasks, processes them, and saves the results to shared resources.

2. **Concurrency and Parallelism**:
   - The project demonstrates how to handle concurrency and parallel task processing using **Go** and **Java**.
   - Each implementation showcases the unique features and strengths of these languages in handling concurrent operations.

3. **Thread-Safe Resource Management**:
   - The application incorporates thread-safe mechanisms to avoid deadlocks and data races when multiple threads or goroutines access shared resources.

4. **Educational and Comparative**:
   - It serves as a comparative study of concurrency models in **Go** vs **Java**, making it useful for developers learning concurrent programming in either language.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - The application includes mechanisms for robust error handling during concurrent operations.

### **How the Code is Implemented**
#### 1. **Go Implementation**
- **Location**: `go/main.go`
- **Key Components**:
  - **`main.go`**:
    - Acts as the entry point for the Go application.
    - Initializes the task queue and worker goroutines.
    - Implements logic for processing tasks and saving results.
  - The modular structure previously seen (e.g., `task.go`, `worker.go`) is now consolidated within `main.go`.

#### 2. **Java Implementation**
- **Location**: `java/src/main/java/com/example/`
- **Key Components**:
  - **`DataProcessorJava.java`**:
    - Serves as the main class to initialize the task queue and manage workers.
  - **`SharedQueue.java`**:
    - Implements thread-safe mechanisms for managing tasks.
  - **`Worker.java`**:
    - Defines worker logic for processing tasks concurrently.
